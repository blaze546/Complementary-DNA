Good Morning,

My name is Brian, I am a 26 year old local boston Software engineer who develops websites for clients on a prject basis and work at the encore casino part time. My lease is exprining on 05/31/23, and ideally I'm looking to move into a new place starting 06/01 with the option of renewing for an additional year. I think I'd be a good fit because it sounds like my lifestyle would mesh well with the current dynamics y'all have. On a personal level I'm a very chill laid back clean guy who spends most of my time at home either coding, watching tv/movies, gaming, reading, working, and cooking. I'd love to hear more about this room, the best way to contact me is via messenger, or directly via phone my number is 617-304-9241, I look forward to hearing from you!
